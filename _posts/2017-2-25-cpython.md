title: Adventures in CPython
---

Ever wanted to write really fast Python code? Then CPython is the way to go. CPython is an implementation of Python in C and is the most popular (and the defacto main) version of Python, though others exists (e.g. [jython](http://www.jython.org/)). Native extensions can be written in CPython and used directly in Python as if it were Python code.

### Why CPython?

The main advantages of CPython are three fold:
1. It is much faster than Python (~ 1-100x)
2. It is relatively easy to interface back and worth between C and Python (so CPython extensions only need to be written for computationally expensive tasks).
3. It is less ugly (and therefore more easy to maintain) than using some bindings like `ctypes` imo

The primary downside is that verbosity (and therefore development time) increases substantially, as we'll see in the example below. These considerations are why the Python community has [so](http://www.swig.org/) [many](https://github.com/google/grumpy) [alternatives](https://pypy.org/) to avoid using CPython and is not useful for every project. However, setting up the module initially was the hardest part for me, after that, adding function and methods was relatively simple.

### Reference Counting

One core idea to CPython is the explicit reference counting. Each object needs to be manually `Py_INCREF` when it is allocated in the heap then `Py_DECREF` when it is no longer needed. It is important to know this because some functions "steal" references (AKA `Py_DECREF` for you) whereas other don't (the majority don't). This is helpful so the Python Garbage Collector knows when to deallocate memory.

### Example

![BGR image before swapping and cropping]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cpython/bgr.jpg)

My first use of CPython was with a camera that had a library written in C so it was natural to use CPython to communicate with the main Python codebase. One of the tasks was to swap the raw BGR to the more useful RGB image format so that I no longer look like a smurf as above. In addition, the image height needed to be cropped. This is how I did it in CPython using Numpy (`color_array` is a numpy array representing the image):

<pre><code>    static PyObject * slice_color(PyObject * color_array, PyObject * line_color_range)
    {
        PyObject * none = Py_None;
        PyObject * zero = PyLong_FromLong(0);
        PyObject * one = PyLong_FromLong(1);
        PyObject * reverse = PyLong_FromLong(-1);
        PyObject * start = PyObject_GetItem(line_color_range, zero);
        PyObject * end = PyObject_GetItem(line_color_range, one);
        PyObject * sw = PySlice_New(start, end, none);
        PyObject * sh = PySlice_New(none, none, none);
        PyObject * sd = PySlice_New(none, none, reverse);
        PyObject * index = Py_BuildValue("(OOO)", sw, sh, sd);
        Py_DECREF(sw); Py_DECREF(sh); Py_DECREF(sd);
        Py_DECREF(none); Py_DECREF(reverse); Py_DECREF(start); Py_DECREF(end);
        Py_DECREF(zero); Py_DECREF(one);

        PyObject * cropped_rgb_array = PyObject_GetItem(color_array, index);
        Py_INCREF(cropped_rgb_array); Py_DECREF(index);

        return cropped_rgb_array;
    }
</code></pre>

In contrast, equivilant in Python would be:

<pre><code>    cropped_rgb_array = color_array[line_color_range[0]:line_color_range[1],:,::-1]</code></pre>

That's right, one python line becomes ~20 lines and in this particular case isn't much faster. In either case we get the wanted result:

![Cropped RGB image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cpython/rgb-cropped.jpg)

## Conclusion

CPython isn't suited for every task but it is certainly go
